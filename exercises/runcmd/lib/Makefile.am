## Reminder for versioning
##
## Versioning: CURRENT:REVISION:AGE
## CURRENT The latest interface implemented.
## REVISION The implementation number of CURRENT (read: number of bugs fixed...)
## AGE The number of interfaces implemented, minus one.
## The library supports all interfaces between CURRENT âˆ’ AGE and CURRENT.
##
## If you have 
## not changed the interface (bug fixes)         CURRENT : REVISION+1 : AGE
## augmented the interface (new functions)       CURRENT+1 : 0 : AGE+1
## broken old interface (e.g. removed functions) CURRENT+1 : 0 : 0

# CONFIGURATION
#
# The list of projects to be updated is obtained from PROJLIST file (blank lines
# and lines starting with '#' are discarted). Projects are cloned from 
# GITRUL/<project_name> into PROJDIR/<project_name>, if a local respository is not
# found in that directory; otherwise, the project is pulled. Errors are reported in
# file LOGFILE.

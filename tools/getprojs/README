getprojs.sh	Updates all projects from from a git respository

   This script reads a list of project names from a file containing repository
   names and updates a local copy of each listed repositories. If a local
   repository is found, the project is pulled; otherwise it is clonned. Errors
   are reported in a log file. 

   Please refer to the script's source code for further information and
   configuration directions.
